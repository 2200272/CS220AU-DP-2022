Climate change is a pressing global issue that has been receiving increasing media coverage in recent years. The media is providing a conflicting perspective on the issue of climate change. Journalists and news outlets are reporting on what might seem to be a significant cause of climate change such as consumer behavior. Media is marginalizing the influence of other important causes such as military activities and weapons such as bombs and missiles. While the effects of climate change can be seen in various regions around the world, the issue is particularly relevant in regions that are already prone to war and military attacks. One such region is Palestine, where the ongoing Israel’s invasion of Palestine has had a significant impact on the environment and climate. For example, Israel’s military practices including air forces and missiles attacking Palestine with huge numbers of weapons and bombs.


The video below is demonstrating an interview with an 86 year old man who lived during the Israel’s occupation of Palestine which has lasted for 75 years since 1948 until today . He witnessed different stages of the war of Israel’s occupation of Palestine which ended with the foundation of Israel and the Nakba of 1948 which means the incident of killing and displacing Palestinians from their homes. The second interviewee is a chemical engineer and an environment advocate who provided insightful knowledge about the climate change scientific causes and her perspective about media coverage of the issue.

The war in Palestine has led to a displacement of many local residents, who are forced to flee their homes and communities as a result of the attacks. In the video a case study interview was conducted with Ibrahim Al-Muqbel, providing a first-hand experience of living under attacks of bombs and weapons. Where the consumer himself was at a life-threatening event. He spoke of the emotional trauma he experienced as he was forced to leave behind his home, possessions and community.

In Palestine, the effects of climate change are exacerbated by the ongoing war and the use of military weapons. The use of heavy artillery, tanks, and other military equipment has caused widespread destruction of the natural environment, including the destruction of forests, wetlands, and other vital ecosystems. This has led to a loss of biodiversity and a reduction in the ability of the land to absorb carbon and other greenhouse gases, contributing to the overall warming of the planet. 

According to Petras (2006), US is backing Israel unconditionally by providing financial and advanced weapon equipment support to bomb Palestine and Gaza strike resulting in massive number of people being killed and high amount of fossil fuel burnt. On contrast, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is working towards reducing emissions globally!
People in Palestine today are still being bombed, the Sheikh Jarrah incident...

Environmental awareness is certainly an important topic. But while we do have to care about our environment, surely environment advocates can also be accused of being more concerned with saving the planet than saving lives. We must ask ourselves why we are bombarded with having an environmental-friendly life when missiles and nuclear bombs are killing people and destroying the Ozone layer that protects our planet.
