# Media coverage of climate change and how wars impact it
## Case study of Palestine's war

Climate change is a pressing global issue that has been receiving increasing media coverage in recent years. Media platforms are providing conflicting perspectives on the issue of climate change. Journalists and news outlets are reporting on what might seem to be a significant cause of climate change such as consumer behaviour. Indeed, the media is marginalizing the influence of other important causes. For instance, military activities and weapons such as bombs and missiles. The effects of climate change can be seen in various regions around the world, the issue is particularly relevant in regions that are already prone to war and military attacks. One such region is Palestine, where ongoing Israel’s invasion of Palestine has had a significant impact on the environment and climate. For example, Israel’s military practices include air forces and missiles attacking Palestine with huge numbers of weapons and bombs used.

The video below is demonstrating an interview with an 86-year-old man who lived during the Israel’s attack on Palestine to take over it, which has lasted for 75 years since 1948 until today. He witnessed different severe situations of the war which ended with the foundation of Israel and the Nakba of 1948 which means the incident of killing and displacing Palestinians from their homes. The second interviewee is a chemical engineer and an environmental advocate who provided insightful knowledge about the climate change scientific causes and her perspective on media coverage of the issue.

**Deeper insight into the topic:**

Environmental awareness is certainly an important topic. But while we do have to care about our environment, surely environment advocates can also be accused of being more concerned with saving the planet than saving lives. We must ask ourselves why we are bombarded with having an environmental-friendly life when missiles and bombs are killing people and destroying the Ozone layer that protects our planet. Despite the significant impact of the war on the environment and climate in Palestine, media coverage of this issue has been relatively limited. Many mainstream media outlets have focused on consumer behaviour, rather than the impact of bombs and weapons of the attacker on the environment and climate. This lack of coverage has made it difficult for the international community to fully understand the severity of the problem and to take action to address it.

The war in Palestine has led to the displacement of many residents, who were forced to flee their homes as a result of the attacks. In the video above, a case study interview was conducted with Ibrahim Al-Muqbel, providing a first-hand experience of living under the attacks of bombs and missiles. Where the consumer himself was at a life-threatening event. He spoke of the emotional trauma he experienced as he was forced to leave behind his home, possessions and community.

The chemical engineer, Dana Al-Muqbel, mentioned that 6% of climate change is caused by military weapons and bombs (Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, 2022). This is considered a high percentage, yet the media is marginalizing the influence and focuses on other causes related to consumer behaviour. The chemical enngineer provided us with a study by (Sharon et al., 2008), where the results showcased how military activities deplete the ozone layer by introducing nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the stratosphere `"An estimated 30% by weight are released by each operational aircraft, missile or rocket launch."`

In Palestine, the effects of climate change are exacerbated by the ongoing war and the use of military weapons. The use of heavy artillery, tanks, and other military equipment has caused widespread destruction of the natural environment, including the destruction of forests, wetlands, and other vital ecosystems. This has led to a loss of biodiversity and a reduction in the ability of the land to absorb carbon and other greenhouse gases, contributing to the overall warming of the planet to higher temperature.

According to Petras (2006), The United States has historically provided significant financial and military support to Israel, which has been used to attack  Palestine and the Gaza strip with bombs and missiles that resulted in a massive number of people being killed and a high amount of fossil fuel burnt. Contradictorily, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) whose mission is to protect human health and the environment is working towards reducing emissions globally.  

Palestine today is still being bombed, the Sheikh Jarrah incident refers to the use of advanced weapons to forcibly evacuate the homes of the Palestinian families in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem. The evictions have been met with widespread protests and international condemnation, with many accusing Israel of violating international law and committing human rights crimes. The number of people killed during the incident is () which was the result of many bombs Israel dropped all over Palestine's cities.

Detecting a specific reason behind the fewer media attention on the effect of wars on climate change can be difficult and complicated. some possible reasons might be because of the significant amount of media coverage of Wars, and as a result, less attention is given to the effects of these wars on climate change. However, political hidden agenda should be considered as a possible reason because some governments and political groups may not want to draw attention to the environmental impact of wars, as it may reflect poorly on their actions or policies. 

**Survey results:**

After doing interviews with 13 students at the University of Essex in the UK. I asked them the following question "Is the effect of wars on climate change being addressed enough in the media?". The results of the statistics, as shown in the pie chart below, are 17% of them said yes and 83% of them said no. Students who said yes justified their answer by claiming that the media is focusing on many causes and wars are one of the causes mentioned. on the other hand, students who said no, justified their answer by claiming that when they think about climate change, the first cause that pops into their mind is plastics and consumer behaviour. One of the students said that there is more focus on sustainability and environmental-friendly lifestyle in media which made the effect of bigger causes marginalized.

In conclusion, the ongoing wars in Palestine and other parts of the world have had a significant impact on the environment and climate globally. The use of military weapons has caused widespread destruction of the natural environment, while displacement and loss of traditional knowledge have made it more difficult for local communities to adapt to the changing climate. However, the issue has received limited media coverage, making it difficult for the international community to fully understand the extent of the problem and to take action to address it.
